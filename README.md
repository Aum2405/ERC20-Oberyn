2. Open the ERC-20 token contract in the Remix IDE.
3. In terminal, run the command: `npx hardhat node`.
4. In the Remix IDE, change the environment to "hardhat" to connect to the local network.
5. Compile and deploy the ERC-20 token contract using Remix.
6. Once the contract is deployed, you can perform various operations such as:
